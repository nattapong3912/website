This new Rideable Vehicle can be purchased from the Store with 1500 M Gold, the beta testers get a exclusive Feikrari Model for Free! (Feik's courtesy owo).
As this project is completely open-source, you can check out how to make your own texture for it, in your mwch-server plugin pack edit the propertie ``"texture"``
to ``"test"`` and get an idea of where are the vehicle parts.

## Test Texture (is in the 1.3> mwch-server plugin packs)
